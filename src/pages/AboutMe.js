                    <p>
                        I am Taylor Bowen, a front-end developer based in Michigan. I have a long background in the restaurant industry that
                        helped me understand the importance of working as a team, completing tasks under pressure, and organization.

                    </br>
                    <p>
                        My passion is writing organized, and multi-browser compatible code that meets the customers wants and needs. Customers are not only the clients we work with, but also our team and those who will come after us.
                        I put great importance in staying educated on new technologies and cohesively working as part of a team to accomplish goals.

                    <p>
                        I regularly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am also proficient with express and MySQL.
